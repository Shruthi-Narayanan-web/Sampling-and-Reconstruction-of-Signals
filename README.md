# Sampling-and-Reconstruction-of-Signals
Simulation of Sampling of signals using the Nyquist criterion and its reconstruction using the sinc function with MATLAB software

## Overview
This project demonstrates sampling and reconstruction of a bandlimited signal using sinc interpolation.
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is introduced to model real-world signal degradation.

## Concepts Used
- Nyquist sampling theorem
- Ideal sinc reconstruction
- Additive white Gaussian noise
- Effect of noise on reconstructed signal

## Tools Used
- MATLAB

## How to Run
1. Open `sampling_reconstruction_1.m` in MATLAB
2. Run the script
3. Observe time-domain plots of original, noisy, and reconstructed signals

## Results
